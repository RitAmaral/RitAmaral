My name is **Rita** 😁, I'm currently enrolled in a training program called **Software Developer** 📖💻, where I am building my theoretical knowledge and technical skills necessary to enter the professional job market in the field of Web and Mobile Programming.

During this program, I have been exposed to various software architectures, such as the *Model-View-Controller* pattern, and have gained hands-on experience with databases like *MySQL*. Additionally, I have been actively learning client-side technologies such as *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*, as well as server-side web platforms like *PHP Laravel*. In the realm of mobile app development, I have been working with *Kotlin* 📱.

This learning experience has been incredible, and I am truly passionate about exploring the vast world of programming. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in order to contribute to innovative projects in the future.
